# Goal

Get to a functioning workspace with an RFP broken into **areas of work** you can assign and track.

## Prerequisites

- Grantable account (any tier)

- An RFP document (PDF or DOCX with selectable text)

## Steps

1. From **Home → New workspace**, name your workspace and choose a type (\*\*Solo / Agency / Higher-Ed\*\*).  

2. Open the workspace and select **Add RFP → Upload**. Attach your RFP file.  

3. After upload, click **Break down with Chat** to generate **areas of work** from the RFP.  

4. Review the generated list in **Areas of work**.  

   - Rename any items that are unclear.  

   - Delete anything out of scope for this submission.  

5. Assign responsibilities: open an item → **Assignee** → choose yourself or a teammate.  

6. (Optional) Add timing and guardrails:  

   - Set **Due date** on each area of work.  

   - If applicable, open **Eligibility & Evidence** and add any must-have checks (links, files, notes).  

7. Open **Rubric coverage** to spot gaps. Click a gap to jump to the area of work and fill it.

## Result

You have a ready-to-work workspace: the RFP is uploaded, areas of work exist, owners are assigned, and gaps are visible in the coverage view.

## Troubleshooting

- **No areas of work were created** → Ensure the RFP text is selectable (re-export or OCR if it’s a scan).  

- **Breakdown stalled or timed out** → Try a smaller file (\<50 MB) or split the RFP appendices into separate uploads.  

- **Can’t assign a teammate** → They must be in the workspace. See _Invite your team & set roles_.  

- **Coverage still shows gaps after edits** → Click **Refresh coverage** in the rubric view.

## Next steps

- **Invite your team & set roles** → `/how-to/invite-team`  

- **Configure eligibility & evidence gates** → `/how-to/eligibility-gates`  

- **Use the rubric coverage meter to close gaps** → `/how-to/rubric-coverage`
